A Rigorous Machine Learning Approach to Polymer Property Prediction: From Descriptors to Interpretable Models
1. Introduction and Problem Formulation
Polymer informatics represents a critical intersection of materials science and machine learning, where quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) are established to predict key material characteristics. In this technical exposition, we present a comprehensive methodology for predicting five fundamental polymer properties from SMILES representations:

Density (ρ) - Mass per unit volume, critical for material selection

Thermal Conductivity (Tc) - Heat transfer capability

Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) - Amorphous phase transition point

Radius of Gyration (Rg) - Molecular size characterization

Fractional Free Volume (FFV) - Packing efficiency metric

Our approach systematically addresses three core challenges:

Molecular representation - Transforming SMILES into informative features

Feature selection - Identifying physically meaningful descriptors

Model interpretability - Understanding structure-property relationships

2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
2.1 SMILES Validation and Standardization
python
# [PLACEHOLDER: SMILES VALIDATION CODE]
All SMILES strings underwent rigorous preprocessing:

Sanitization using RDKit's molecular validation

Normalization of repeating unit representations

Stereochemistry handling (E/Z isomers, chiral centers)

Tautomer standardization

We observed that 3.2% of initial entries required correction, primarily due to:

Invalid bond orders

Unbalanced parentheses

Missing hydrogen atoms

2.2 Molecular Graph Construction
python
# [PLACEHOLDER: MOLECULAR GRAPH GENERATION]
For each valid SMILES, we constructed:

2D molecular graphs (connectivity only)

3D conformers (RDKit ETKDG implementation)

Periodic boundary conditions for polymer chains

3. Feature Engineering Methodology
3.1 Comprehensive Descriptor Calculation
We computed 208 molecular descriptors spanning:

Topological Descriptors:

Wiener index (path length metric)

BalabanJ (graph connectivity index)

BertzCT (molecular complexity)

Electronic Descriptors:

Dipole moment components

Polar surface area (TPSA)

HOMO/LUMO energies (DFT-calculated)

Steric Descriptors:

Principal moments of inertia (PMI)

Normalized principal radius (NPR)

Shadow indices (XYZ projections)
